**Project Title**: Simple Calculator using Python Tkinter
**Project Description**:
🤖This project is a graphical user interface (GUI)-based simple calculator developed using the Tkinter library in Python. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage, and decimal calculations.

**The user interface is designed to be clean and user-friendly, featuring:**

⚙️A display area to show input and results.

⚙️Buttons for digits (0–9), double zero (00), decimal point (.), and arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %).

⚙️A clear (C) button to reset the input.

⚙️An equals (=) button to compute and display the result.

⚙️The calculator dynamically updates the display as users press the buttons and uses Python's eval() function to evaluate the input expression. It also handles basic error-checking, such as invalid inputs.

**The project demonstrates core programming concepts such as:**

⚙️Event handling through button clicks,

⚙️String manipulation,

⚙️GUI layout management using .place() and .pack(),

⚙️Exception handling in Python.
